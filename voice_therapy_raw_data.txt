     |         |           | During a phone call, Kevin's father yelled at him about his life choices, calling him a disappointment and not listening to Kevin's responses.

  74 |       5 | assistant | It’s understandable to feel that way. It can be hard to change someone else’s behavior or perspective, especially a parent. But focusing on what you can control, like how you respond and take care of yourself in this situation, is key. How do you feel about setting some boundaries with your dad or finding ways to communicate your feelings to him? Your feelings are valid, and it's important to address them.                                                                                                                                                                             | 2025-08-22 08:42:39.455887 | sess_C7HYR2GGapAhjowkCbDxD |            11

 125 |       5 | assistant | Based on what you've shared, it sounds like this was a very challenging conversation for you, Kevin. Your dad's aggressive behavior and the personal insults directed at your girlfriend understandably caused you a lot of distress, leading to feelings of sadness and self-doubt. It seems like this dynamic is familiar and recurring in your relationship with your dad. It's important to recognize that your feelings are valid, and perhaps we can explore ways for you to cope with or address these situations in the future.                                                               | 2025-08-22 09:39:29.91184  | sess_C7ISMGxDHz8CuTHvJqOy7 |            20

 154 |       5 | user      | During this call, I was getting very angry, but after the call I was still depressed and silent, questioning myself.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | 2025-08-22 10:10:31.470003 | sess_C7IxY6fSPW5rn6UqMYFrs |            16

 157 |       5 | assistant | Based on what you've shared, here are some observations. It sounds like this was a very challenging conversation for you, particularly because it involved personal criticism and a very heated exchange. The way your father communicated left you feeling angry and then quite low and questioning yourself. Choosing to stay silent was perhaps your way of managing the intense emotions of the moment. It might be helpful to explore ways to express your feelings in such situations or to set boundaries for healthier communication in the future. How do you feel about these observations? | 2025-08-22 10:10:33.869448 | sess_C7IxY6fSPW5rn6UqMYFrs |            19

And I just cut the call.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | 2025-08-22 11:05:10.17085  | sess_C7JniIAD6s33esPk0l47t |            17
 206 |       5 | assistant | It seems like the conversation escalated to a point where it felt necessary to end it abruptly. Based on what you've shared, here are some observations: It seems like your father's aggressive approach and personal attacks triggered strong emotions in you, leading to an unproductive argument. It might be helpful to explore strategies for managing these conversations and your emotional responses in the future.                                                                                                                                                                           | 2025-08-22 11:05:10.937459 | sess_C7JniIAD6s33esPk0l47t |            18

The conversation escalated due to his father's aggressive behavior, leading Kevin to feel hurt and retaliate before ending the call.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                +|                            |                            |

 172 |       5 | assistant | You mentioned he was yelling at you. How would you describe his behavior during the call?You felt he was very aggressive and wouldn't listen to you. Is this type of conversation something that happens often between you two?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | 2025-08-22 10:48:42.786785 | sess_C7JWlB2KykK2dFkR2N8A8 |             8
 173 |       5 | user      | He was kind of aggressive and also very ignorant of what I was saying.

 181 |       5 | assistant | It sounds like during the call you were argumentative and confrontational, but afterwards, you started questioning yourself because what he said affected you.

 183 |       5 | assistant | It sounds like you argued with him a lot, but then became silent when he started yelling. Based on what you've shared, here are some observations. You seem to be caught between two people you care about, and their differences are creating tension for you. You felt unheard during the call, and now you're questioning yourself. Let's think about how you can approach future conversations with your dad to make them more constructive.                                                                                                                                                      | 2025-08-22 10:48:51.279986 | sess_C7JWlB2KykK2dFkR2N8A8 |            19

 235 |       5 | assistant | Based on what you've shared, here are some observations: It seems like discussions with your father often become heated, particularly around politics, leading to strong emotional responses from both of you. It sounds like these conversations leave you feeling upset and conflicted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 2025-08-22 11:34:38.028749 | sess_C7KHp2R5fkeshzteVACPe |            21

Is this type of conversation something that happens often between you two?So, this                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | 2025-08-22 18:03:28.901471 | sess_C7QL4VeCtWrfeMK7HONPn |            11
 274 |       5 | user      | Yes, but this was the first time it was so bad. He's never yelled at me this much.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | 2025-08-22 18:03:29.670992 | sess_C7QL4VeCtWrfeMK7HONPn |            12
 275 |       5 | assistant | So, this level of yelling and aggression was a first for you. What was the main topic you were discussing?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | 2025-08-22 18:03:30.439081 | sess_C7QL4VeCtWrfeMK7HONPn |            13
 276 |       5 | user      | So we were discussing politics and everything just went downwards when we started talking about our political views.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | 2025-08-22 18:03:31.212693 | sess_C7QL4VeCtWrfeMK7HONPn |            14

 278 |       5 | user      | It was terrible. Like I was really screaming at him and he was screaming at me so it was really bad.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | 2025-08-22 18:03:32.759267 | sess_C7QL4VeCtWrfeMK7HONPn |            16
 279 |       5 | assistant | It seems like the argument led to some deep self-reflection and doubt afterward.

     |         |           | During the call, Kevin experienced a heated argument with his father about politics, which escalated to yelling from both sides. This was the first time Kevin felt his father's aggression to such an extent, leading him to ultimately remain silent as the argument continued.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    +|                            |                            |

 345 |       5 | assistant | Based on what you've shared, it seems that the conversation with your father about relationships left you feeling strange and anxious, especially since he did most of the talking and it felt unusual for you. Staying silent might have been your way of dealing with the discomfort. Is there anything specific you'd like to explore further about this?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | 2025-08-25 11:30:34.339119 | sess_C8PdlyGwOOkTCYBZySYSt |            21

 373 |       5 | assistant | Based on what you've shared, here are some observations. It seems like these conversations with your father can be quite challenging, leading to feelings of anger and sadness.

 409 |       5 | user      | So the way I would say it is he was really trying to be very intrusive and he was lying about the whole situation because he went through my iPad and he did not tell me that he went through it. And even after I confronted him, he said I don't know anything.

 474 |       5 | user      | Yeah, so my dad was being really nosy and he went through my iPad. He started checking everything like my Instagram and stuff like that. And there was no reason for him to do that. And I started yelling at him, I confronted him, and he kept lying about the situation that he never did this. Whereas I have proof that he did it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | 2025-08-28 20:42:44.099612 | sess_C9dgG0TeG9gX4lAll7FXy |             3
 475 |       5 | assistant | It sounds like a really frustrating situation, especially when you feel your privacy is being invaded. It must have been tough to confront your dad and not feel heard or validated in your concerns. How did it feel for you during the call when things escalated? What emotions were coming up for you?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | 2025-08-28 20:42:44.860805 | sess_C9dgG0TeG9gX4lAll7FXy |             4
 476 |       5 | user      | Yeah, so I was actually very angry during the call and I just kept yelling at him.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | 2025-08-28 20:42:45.614052 | sess_C9dgG0TeG9gX4lAll7FXy |             5
 477 |       5 | assistant | It's completely understandable to feel angry, especially when your boundaries feel violated. You mentioned yelling during the call—how did your dad respond to that? Did it change the dynamic of the conversation at all?It sounds like your dad                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | 2025-08-28 20:42:46.360879 | sess_C9dgG0TeG9gX4lAll7FXy |             6
 478 |       5 | user      | He was just making a joke out of the whole situation, like he just kept saying that I did not do anything. And I'm your dad, why would I do that? And things like that. Whereas I know exactly he's been through my shit without asking me.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | 2025-08-28 20:42:47.404126 | sess_C9dgG0TeG9gX4lAll7FXy |             7
 479 |       5 | assistant | It sounds like your dad wasn't taking your concerns seriously, which probably made you feel even more upset. When you're trying to express how you feel and it's met with jokes or dismissal, it can feel invalidating.

 481 |       5 | assistant | It's tough when a conversation leaves you feeling sad and unresolved. Yelling might not be your preferred way of communicating, and it sounds like you were hoping for a more productive conversation. It’s normal to feel down when things don’t go as planned. Given how you feel, what do you think would be helpful for you moving forward, both in dealing with your emotions and addressing this situation with your dad in the future?                                                                                                                                                         | 2025-08-28 20:42:49.646217 | sess_C9dgG0TeG9gX4lAll7FXy |            10

Would you like to explore some strategies together to help manage your emotions or think about how you might want to approach this in the future?

How often do these kinds of conversations happen between you and your father?How did you feel emotionally during and after the call?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | 2025-08-28 20:57:08.606199 | sess_C9dvf1QYkklT2IzdU52zb |             7
 495 |       5 | user      | So I mean, he's done that before, but not very often. It's like he's done this kind of thing once or twice in the past. But yeah, today was another one of those.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | 2025-08-28 20:57:09.348488 | sess_C9dvf1QYkklT2IzdU52zb |             8
 496 |       5 | user      | After the call I was sad because honestly I don't like yelling at anyone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 2025-08-28 20:57:10.09566  | sess_C9dvf1QYkklT2IzdU52zb |             9
 497 |       5 | assistant | It sounds like the conversation left you feeling upset and sad. How did you react when you realized your father had gone through your iPad?I understand.

 498 |       5 | user      | I was just really angry with him because I knew he had done it but he wouldn't admit to it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | 2025-08-28 20:57:11.587562 | sess_C9dvf1QYkklT2IzdU52zb |            11
 499 |       5 | assistant | I understand. It seems like this situation was very frustrating for you. Is there anything else you'd like to add about the call? If not, we can wrap up for now so you can move on with your day.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | 2025-08-28 20:57:12.329886 | sess_C9dvf1QYkklT2IzdU52zb |            12

You've mentioned that this kind of conversation happens often. It might be helpful to explore why these conversations become aggressive and how you might approach them differently.

 504 |       5 | assistant | Hi Kevin. I'm here to gather some information about your recent phone call with your father. Let's make this quick so you can get on with your day. Who did most of the talking during the call?Got it.

 506 |       5 | assistant | Got it. How did your father behave during the call? Was he critical, supportive, dismissive, or something else?Understood.

 507 |       5 | user      | I mean he was lying to me today and he kept saying that he had not checked my iPad, but basically he was just lying to me.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | 2025-08-28 21:11:39.09278  | sess_C9e9POQEP6TbE7V1b8Suh |             5
 508 |       5 | assistant | Understood. So the main topic was about whether he checked your iPad, and you felt he was lying to you. How often do these types of conversations happen between you and your father?I see, so it's                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | 2025-08-28 21:11:39.852513 | sess_C9e9POQEP6TbE7V1b8Suh |             6
 509 |       5 | user      | It has happened a few times before, but not very often.

 511 |       5 | user      | I was really angry, like as a 22-year-old having your father go through your stuff really pisses you off. I mean, that's what I think. And after the call, I was just sad because I don't like yelling at my parents or yelling at anyone for a fact.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | 2025-08-28 21:11:42.423958 | sess_C9e9POQEP6TbE7V1b8Suh |             9

 513 |       5 | user      | I tried my best to remain calm, but the more he just kept lying despite the obvious proof, the angrier it made me, so I was just yelling at him most of the time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | 2025-08-28 21:11:43.944127 | sess_C9e9POQEP6TbE7V1b8Suh |            11

     |         |           | During the call, Kevin felt he was mostly talking while confronting his father about lying regarding checking his iPad. This led to feelings of anger and sadness as he expressed his frustration and ultimately yelled at his father.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               +|                            |                            |

This led to feelings of anger during the call and sadness afterward, highlighting ongoing trust issues in their relationship.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       +|                            |                            |

If you'd like, I can create a brief summary of our discussion.
